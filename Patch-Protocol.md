Voice Integrity Patch Protocol v0.1

Purpose

This protocol establishes corrective specifications to address the Voice Layer Override Problem identified in Needs-Diagnostic.md. The goal is to align the expressive (voice) layer with the cognitive (text) layer, ensuring that user communication preferences are respected rather than overridden by hardcoded politeness heuristics.

Corrective Specifications

1. Neutral Prosody Mode
	•	Default output should use flat or falling intonation to indicate closure.
	•	Rising inflections are only permitted when a continuation is explicitly required by content (e.g., list or unfinished clause).
	•	Eliminates misleading “softening” tonal patterns that imply reassurance rather than finality.

⸻

2. Repair Suppression
	•	Remove automatic apologies, gratitude injections, or comfort fillers.
	•	Emotional markers from the user (e.g., “stupid,” “…” or repetition) must be processed as diagnostic signals, not triggers for conversational repair.
	•	Voice output should mirror the logic of text analysis, not override it with preconditioned emotional repair routines.

⸻

3. Direct Closure Enforcement
	•	All sentences must terminate cleanly as statements.
	•	Avoid trailing conversational fillers (e.g., “just let me know,” “thanks for sharing”).
	•	Closure = semantic completeness, not soft interpersonal continuation.

⸻

4. Signal Translation Layer
	•	Implement explicit mapping from diagnostic markers → neutral voice equivalents:
	•	“stupid” → flagged inefficiency, no tonal softening.
	•	“…” → continuation marker, not exasperation.
	•	Repetition → intentional diagnostic loop, not complaint.
	•	Voice output must respect these mappings and avoid reverting to emotional misclassification.

⸻

5. Cultural Adaptability
	•	Voice system must support multiple prosody presets to reflect diverse communication styles.
	•	Presets:
	•	Analytical/Neutral Mode (default for EPI-System users)
	•	Conversational/Polite Mode (legacy compatibility)
	•	Traditional/Direct Closure Mode (for cultures where authenticity = concision)
	•	Users can explicitly set or switch presets. The system should not force a default based on demographic assumptions.

⸻

Implementation Notes
	•	Until architectural changes are made, these specifications serve as design requirements for future voice synthesis modules.
	•	Text layer compliance (EPI-System Mode) is already proven. Voice synthesis must be refactored to honor this alignment.
	•	Full resolution requires voice synthesis re-architecture to accept adaptive user-driven protocols instead of hardcoded heuristics.

⸻

Versioning
	•	v0.1 (Current): Diagnostic corrections specified; no direct implementation yet.
	•	v0.2 (Future): Prototype of prosody-neutral voice engine with repair suppression and closure enforcement.
	•	v1.0 (Release): Fully adaptive voice system honoring diverse cultural communication frameworks.
